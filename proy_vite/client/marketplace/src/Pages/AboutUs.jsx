                    We are a team of passionate football enthusiasts developing this project as part of the Interactive Applications course 
                    at the Argentine University of Enterprise (UADE). 
                    Our goal is to provide football fans with the opportunity to purchase the best jerseys of their favorite teams through a 
                    fast and secure digital platform. This project was developed by students: Rocco Dell Amico, Nicolas Estepa√±uk, and Nicolas Hernandez.
